/*
 * Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class has a single responsibility. The Animal subclasses
 *  don't need to manage their own behavior logic; they delegate it to behavior classes.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Classes are open for extension but closed for modification. You can add
 new behaviors without changing the existing classes. For example, if you need a new type of walking
  behavior, you just create a new class that implements the WalkingBehaviour interface.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Classes depend on small, specific interfaces rather than
 one large interface. This avoids forcing classes to implement methods they donâ€™t need.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules (like Dog, Peacock, Fish, etc.) do not depend
 on low-level modules (specific behaviors) directly. Instead, they depend on abstractions (interfaces),
  making the system more flexible and easier to maintain.

Flexibility and Testability: By using dependency injection, you can easily swap out behavior
 implementations without changing the classes. This makes the system highly flexible and easy to test,
  as you can inject mock behaviors for testing purposes.
 */


// In this implementation we are overriding the methods for every animal for example if 
// two animals is having exactly same behavior then in such a condition we are rewriting the code 
// again and again...
/*
 * Lack of Flexibility: In this code, the behaviors like walk(), fly(), etc., are hardcoded within
 *  the animal classes (Dog, Peacock, etc.). This makes it difficult to change the behavior without modifying
 *   the class itself.

Violation of the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Some classes were forced to implement interfaces 
they didn't need. For example, Fish implements SwimingBehaviour but was incorrectly forced to implement
 fly(). This is a clear violation of ISP, which states that no client should be forced to depend on methods
  it does not use.

Difficult to Extend: If you wanted to add a new behavior or modify an existing one, you would have to change
 the existing classes. This approach goes against the Open/Closed Principle (OCP), which states that classes
  should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Hard to Test: Hardcoding behaviors makes it difficult to unit test classes in isolation. You'd need to test
 the entire class along with all its behaviors, which isn't efficient or effective.

By using dependency injection and smaller interfaces, you achieve:
